/* (3) Next, the script inserts into a relational table MESSAGE information about the contents of a sample database that 
       violate the consistency constraint. "An employee cannot work more than 70 hours in total per week"
       The script must list the outcomes of verification of the consistency constraint as a single column table with 
       the following messages as the rows in the table.

       An employee <insert employee number here> is working more than 70 hours in total per week.

       For example, if an employee 007 is working more than 70 hours per week then the following text must be inserted into 
       a relational table MESSAGE.

       An employee 007 is working more than 70 hours in total per week.      	   	       		      	  	       	       
       HINT: use a row function CONCAT to create the messages like the one listed above. E.g. CONCAT('An employee', enumber, 'is working more than 70 hours in total per week.')
